# LWLRF (Light-weight LiDAR-RADAR Fusion)
A light-weight, modular LiDAR-RADAR Sensor Fusion model

# Obtaining Dependecies

The core of LWLRF relies on packages that can easily be resolved utilizing the following command

`rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src`

Importantly, due to the current way the implementation is configured, there is an additional dependency for nav_ross which can be found [here](https://github.com/unmannedlab/navtechradar_usl).
